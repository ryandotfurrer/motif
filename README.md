LinkedIn for musicians

## About

As a former musician focused on education and performance, I never felt like LinkedIn was a place where musicians could actually build, manage, and keep up with connections they've made throughout their career.

This often leads us to keeping up one another across various social platforms, but not learning of meaningful updates unti you run into that person at a future gig. That's where Motif (name WIP) comes in.

Motif allows you to expand your network, keep in touch with those you've met, find new people to perform with, and more. Quit keeping track of people across countless platforms, and join Motif today.
